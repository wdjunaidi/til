# Switching out of shell window

Spacemacs (emacs) has built in terminal emulator or shell interpreter; however when we are in the shell window we can't use standard Spacemacs <space> leader key binding to switch to other window. To switch to other window within Spacemacs we need to use standard Emacs key binding.

From eshell window: `C-x o`  
From ansi-term window: `C-c o`
